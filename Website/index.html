  <p> This is my very first website. I am excited about it!</p>



 <article>
 	<p> So far it is coming along nicely. I have added wood to the background, and Sam's face permanently floats in the corner! *edit: Sam's face is no longer in the corner. It was creepy. </p> 
 	<p> These are otters! </p>

 	<p> Now, I am just adding text so that I can see what my website looks like when I add things to it, especially as it descends downward. I hope that This is not too much of a problem as I move forward with my project because as it stands I could quite possibly be mucking things up quite a bit. I have managed to remove any semblance of thematic consistency, but I will work on it.
